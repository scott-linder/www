Hi! I'm Scott Linder.

I’m a programmer, system administrator, and avid plaid wearer. This is my
personal website. Feel free to look around and not touch anything.

About Me

I'm interested in computers: hardware, software, administration, *etc.*

I write code at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en). I studied Computer Science at
[WMU](http://cs.wmich.edu/). I am a former president of the [Computer Club at
WMU](https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu/).
